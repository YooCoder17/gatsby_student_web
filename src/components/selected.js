The phase 1 evaluation of amDeC '19  ended on 24th January and we regret to announce that none of the students passed the evaluation. The goal of this program was to improve the coding skills of students and to promote the spirit of open-source. Even though no one passed, we are happy to say that its been a great learning experience for everyone. We wish the best for all the students and hope to see you again next year!

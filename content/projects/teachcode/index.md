content: Teachcode provides 30 basic questions for Python and JavaScript, for validation, the
         output is checked against the correct programs. To take this package to the next level, proper
         tests are missing, there are no proper checks to know if a code change is breaking the code. I
         plan to write tests for full coverage for the same.
